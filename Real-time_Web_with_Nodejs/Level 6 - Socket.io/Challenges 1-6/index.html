<!-- 2.1.) Load the socket.io.js script. The socket.io.js path you should use is
           '/socket.io/socket.io.js'. Express knows to serve the socket.io
           client js for this path. -->

  // 2.2.) Using the global io object that's now available for us, connect to
  //       the socket.io server at http://localhost:8080.
  var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

  // 3.1.) Listen for 'question' events from the server.
  socket.on('question', function(data) {
    // 3.2.) Have the event callback function call the insertQuestion function.
    //       The insertQuestion function is already created for you, and it's
    //       placed in its own file. It expects exactly one argument - the
    //       question.
    insertQuestion(data);
  });
  
  // 7.1.) Listen for the 'answer' event off of the server.
  socket.on('answer', function(question, answer) {
    // 7.2.) Call the answerQuestion function, passing in both the question and
    //       the answer that was broadcast from the server.
    answerQuestion(question, answer);
  });
